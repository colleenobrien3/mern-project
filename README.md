# BrewerDE Fullstack MERN Application

## Descriptions and Features

Using the JavaScript based MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) I created an application that allows Delawareans to find information about nearby breweries. The React frontend fetches data from [the Express backend API](https://evening-ravine-76048.herokuapp.com/breweries) that I created with data from a more general breweries API. I used the Bootstrap CSS framework for styling. Click [here](https://github.com/colleenobrien3/express-crud-api) to see the repo for the backend!

## Goals

In the future, I would love to find an API with data about pizza parlor locations and display nearby pizza parlors for each brewery. Also, I hope to find an API with more information about specific beers that could be found at each brewery. As you can see in the API I created, I did add some of this information, but was pulling data from a fairly limited API.
